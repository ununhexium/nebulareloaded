# Nebulabrot reloaded

Second attempt at computing stupidly big Mandelbrot fractale with nebula rendering.

## Why?

To see the progress made over the last 6 years, mainly.

## Steps

Start with git instead of SVN

Start with the SCM as the first step of the project instead of adding it later

Use Gradle instead of Eclipse

Use a build management system from the begining

Open the project in IJ only after it's been fully initialized
